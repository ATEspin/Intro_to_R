# Introduction to data science in R

>WORK IN PROGRESS. This is a work in progress. I may format this as a bookdown at some point, but for now I am building the material as I have time and teach some of the content to different groups.

I have been working in R for a few years now, and teaching data science to biomedical and health researchers and practitioners for a while. I am putting this material to collect my teaching experience and provide it to those that may find it useful.

It is not an exausting course by no means, but should cover what I think are the important elements that any data practitioner such as all biomedical researchers (whether they do wet lab experiments or computational work) would benefit from knowing. The content, organization and structure of this course is subject to change.

# TOC (subject to change):

0. **Use cases**: some use practical use cases that can be used as learning examples
1. **Introduction to R and coding**: basic introduction to the R envirorment and basics of coding
2. **Data organization and wrangling**: basics of tabular data organization in spreadsheets and data wrangling with tidyverse
3. **Data Visualization in R I**: principles of data visualization and use of ggplot2 gramar of graphics framework in R
4. **Data Visualization in R II**: continuation of data visualization. It might be fused as a single chapter at some point
5. **Applied biostatistics in R**: intended to cover basic biostatistical principles for the analysis of experiments, with focus on application using R
